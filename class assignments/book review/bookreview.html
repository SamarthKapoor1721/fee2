      <h3>Harry Potter:Prisoner of Azkaban</h3>
  </center></b>
  <br>
  <h3>J.K. Rowling's "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" is a significant turning point in the series. It sheds
    its lighter tone, venturing into a darker and more suspenseful atmosphere. The constant threat of Sirius Black, an
    escaped convict from the notorious Azkaban prison, looms over Hogwarts. The Dementors, terrifying creatures who
    guard Azkaban and have the power to suck out souls, cast a pall over the school, creating a constant sense of dread
    and despair. This oppressive atmosphere is a stark contrast to the whimsical charm of the first two books and forces
    Harry to confront his fears in a more profound way.</h3>
